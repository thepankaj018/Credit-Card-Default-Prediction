# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction

The project aims to predict the likelihood of credit card holders defaulting on their next month's payment using the "Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset".This dataset includes information on 30,000 credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005, and includes attributes such as demographic factors, credit data, and history of payment.

The first step in the project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. This includes analyzing the distribution of the data, identifying any missing or duplicate values, and understanding the relationship between different variables. The EDA also includes visualization of the data to gain insights about the distribution of the data and to identify any patterns or outliers in the data.

Once the EDA is complete, the next step is to pre-process the data. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data so that it can be used for machine learning models. The data is also split into training and testing datasets to be used for model training and evaluation.

The next step is to select the appropriate machine learning model for the problem. This includes comparing the performance of different models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, and selecting the model with the highest accuracy. The model is then trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the testing dataset.

After the model is trained and evaluated, the final step is to interpret the results and make recommendations. This includes analyzing the model's performance, interpreting the model's coefficients, and understanding the feature importance. Based on the analysis, recommendations are made for how the model can be used to improve the credit card default prediction process.

In conclusion, the Credit Card Default Prediction project is a crucial step in the credit card industry as it helps financial institutions to identify the likelihood of a credit card holder defaulting on their payments. This project is a combination of Exploratory Data Analysis, Data pre-processing, Model Selection, Training and Evaluation. The model developed in this project can help financial institutions to take appropriate action to prevent defaults and minimize loss. The project provides a comprehensive understanding of the credit card holder's behavior and helps in creating better strategies for the industry.
